# Claude Exporter - TODO List

## Completed ✅

- **Artifact format conversion** (v1.3.0)
  - Support for Original/Markdown/Text/JSON formats
  - Code files always kept in original format
  - Non-code markdown documents convert to selected format

- **Flat artifacts export** (v1.4.0)
  - Independent from nested artifacts option
  - Both can be enabled simultaneously for dual export
  - Flat: exports with `ConversationName_filename` prefix

- **UI reorganization** (v1.5.0-1.5.1)
  - Header 1: Title (left), Stats (right)
  - Header 2: Projects dropdown (left), Search (center), Export controls (right)
  - Removed Model filter dropdown (use column sorting instead)
  - Wider search bar (400px → 500px)
  - Wider table container (1400px → 1600px)

- **Artifact extraction fixes** (v1.5.2)
  - Added support for `code_block` display format (newer artifacts)
  - Maintained support for `json_block` format (older artifacts)
  - Fixed missing artifacts in newer conversations

- **Nested/Flat independence** (v1.5.3)
  - Made nested and flat artifact exports independent options
  - Can export in one or both formats simultaneously

- **Export filename improvements** (v1.5.4)
  - Changed from date to datetime format
  - Format: `claude-exports-2025-10-31_14-30-45.zip`
  - Prevents file collisions on same-day exports

- **Progress bar accuracy** (v1.5.4)
  - Fixed to count all scanned conversations
  - Includes skipped conversations (no artifacts when chats disabled)

- **Projects API support** (v1.6.0)
  - Fetch projects from `/api/organizations/{orgId}/projects`
  - Populate Projects dropdown with user's projects
  - Filter conversations by selected project
  - Renamed export files from 'claude-conversations-*' to 'claude-exports-*'

- **Flat artifacts bug fix** (v1.6.1)
  - Fixed: artifacts only extracted if 'Artifacts nested' was checked
  - Now extracts artifacts if EITHER nested OR flat is checked

- **Projects column** (v1.6.2)
  - Added 'Project' column after 'Name' column
  - Display project name or '-' if no project assigned
  - Full sorting capability for Project column
  - Multi-level sorting with shift+click

- **Flat-only artifacts export** (v1.7.0)
  - When ONLY 'Artifacts flat' is checked (no chats, no nested):
    - Export all artifacts from all conversations into single root folder
    - No conversation subfolders - everything in one big folder
    - Each artifact prefixed with conversation name
    - Filename: `claude-artifacts-{timestamp}.zip` (distinguishes from other exports)

## Pending 🔄

- **Filter bash tool uses from artifact extraction**
  - Sometimes simple bash calls create artifact.sh files
  - Need to better distinguish real artifacts from tool use results
  - Check for additional indicators beyond just `filename` field

## Current Version: 1.7.0

## Notes

- Version bumping helps track changes and catch branch mix-ups
- Projects fully implemented and functional
- All artifact export features are functional and tested
- Flat-only mode makes it easy to get all artifacts in one searchable folder
